# YTDownloader
## A program to download any YouTube video

### Disclaimer
This concept is **not** my idea. I was inspired by **[Clear Code]** from this **[Video]**.
I took the freedom to added some features, such as adding a clickable link, selecting a download directory and make the progressbar more useful.

You can find the orignial code [here].

### Tutorial
The use is rather simple. 
- copy the YT link into the input
- main window opens with two tabs
- first tab (info) contains only information about the video
- the second (download) contains the download buttons together (select download directory before download)
- at the buttom of the download tab is the download progressbar
